# game-of-trains
This project replicates the card game, Game Of Trains in the language C.
Due to saving errors, some of the files are missing updated code. 

# main
The code accepts an optional deck that follows the same convention as the supplied sampledeck.txt (card number, card power).
If you do not use a self created deck, just simply put 'y' to use the standard deck.
The game should execute! Some features have not been fully completed (such as remove power up and others). But
the main swap and other card functions are functional from the test cases I have used. 
One big bug that needs to be fixed is detecting a char character, as stated before the file was not correctly saved and 
lost some of the checks.
